# OpenAI-Token-Counter-with-Tiktoken

Welcome to my project repository! Here, I harness the power of Tiktoken and the OpenAI API to create a Python Streamlit web application with a primary focus on token counting and price estimation.

## Features:

- **Token Counting**: The application efficiently counts tokens, providing insightful analysis and statistics.

- **Price Estimation**: Utilizing the OpenAI API, offering accurate price estimations for the tokens analyzed. Please note that accessing this feature requires an API key. It's important to be aware that charges may apply for requests made to the OpenAI API.

### Note:
- For accurate price estimations through the OpenAI API, users are required to possess an API key. 

- Additionally, it's crucial to understand that sending requests to the OpenAI API may incur charges.

Thank you for your interest in the project!
